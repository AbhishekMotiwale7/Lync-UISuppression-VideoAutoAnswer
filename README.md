Lync-UISuppression-VideoAutoAnswer
==================================

Lync wrapper and WPF control to allow you to easily create UI Suppression mode applications which auto-answer incoming video calls.


Current Functionality:
* UISuppresion Mode WPF application
* Presence status exposed for single user
* Auto-answer video call sent to specific user, two-way video sharing
* Place call to single user, two-way video sharing

Known Issues:
* Possibly outgoing video not always displayed in corner of screen. Seems to be resolved if you retry. We think this may be a hardware device timing issue, or possibly something environmental.
* No visual feedback when placing a call if call is declined.

To Do:
* Fix bugs
* [add features here]


Things to be aware of:

* There is a WPF control which displays either incoming or outgoing video.
* The LyncUISupressionWrapper.LyncModel object is a singleton, so call it with `LyncModel.Instance;`.
* You must call .SignIn as one of the first things you do, otherwise nothing will work!
* When debugging, if you halt your application mid-call/conversation you will leave the underlying Lync process (communicator.exe) in a running state. You will need to kill that process before running again, otherwise you'll get errors that "{Client is in state 'SignedIn', expected 'Uninitialized'}".


To enable UISuppression Mode:
	1. Exit Lync client (and ensure communicator.exe isn't running)
	2. Add registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Communicator\UISuppressionMode as a REG_DWORD with value of 1.
	
To disable UISuppression Mode:
	1. Ensure communicator.exe isn't running.
	2. Set UISuppressionMode key to value of 0.
	3. Restart Lync client.
